# Docx2MoodleXML_v2
This repo is essentially the same as [Docx2MoodleXML](https://github.com/hamza5485/Docx2MoodleXML) and was created for 
the same purpose. There are two differences between this and "v1":

1. In "v1", questions and answers were both found in the same docx file. Here, 
questions are in one file and answers in a separate file.
2. In the previous version, files were guaranteed to follow a standard with no errors. That is
not the case here as discrepancies exist between the question file and the answer file.   

Both these points need to be handled. For a full description of project, please refer to 
"v1" [README](https://github.com/hamza5485/Docx2MoodleXML/blob/main/README.md).  


**NOTE**: *This isn't an iterative update to the original project, just a different "version" of it.*

**NOTE++**: *From the original [README](https://github.com/hamza5485/Docx2MoodleXML/blob/main/README.md):*
> At the time of writing this, the intention was to QUICKLY upload course content to the LMS. As a result, there might be a lot of room for improvement and optimization in this code. May return to this in the future to improve & build upon this.
