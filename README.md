# Docx2MoodleXML_v2
This repo is essentially the same as [Docx2MoodleXML](https://github.com/hamza5485/Docx2MoodleXML) and was created for 
the same purpose. The only difference between this and "v1" is how the code handles docx files. In "v1", questions and 
answers were written in the same docx file. Here, answers and written in a separate file (hence the need for this 
version). For a full description of project, please refer to 
"v1" [README](https://github.com/hamza5485/Docx2MoodleXML/blob/main/README.md).  


**NOTE**: *This isn't an iterative update to the original project, just a different "version" of it.*

**NOTE++**: *From the original [README](https://github.com/hamza5485/Docx2MoodleXML/blob/main/README.md):*
> At the time of writing this, the intention was to QUICKLY upload course content to the LMS. As a result, there might be a lot of room for improvement and optimization in this code. May return to this in the future to improve & build upon this.
